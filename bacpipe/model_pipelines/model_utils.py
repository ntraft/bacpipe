        This base class defines key methods and attributes for all feature
        extractors to ensure that we can use the same processing pipeline
        to generate embeddings. The idea is to 
        
        
        1. initialize the model with prepare_inference, thereby loading 
        the model and loading it onto the selected device.
        
        2. load and resample audio to the sample rate required by the model
        
        3. window the audio into segments corresponding to the required
        input segment length.
        
        4. Calculating spectrograms (if the model architecture is accessible)
        to batch preprocess the audio and potentially be able to in 
        retrospect build the spectrograms to investigate
        
        5. Initialize a torch dataloader object based on the model specific
        audio loading characteristics to speed up the inference process
        and looping through the segments
        
        6. Perform batch inference
        
        
        If 'cuda' has been selected as device, a threading approach is used
        to load data in parallel while performing inference. The return value 
        are the embeddings.

        sr : int

            path to moin model checkpoint dir
        global_batch_size : int
            global batch size that is then used in comjunction with the 
            segment length to calculate a model-specific batch size that
            results in approximately equal batches for different models
